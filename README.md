📋 Overview

The Student Exam Performance Dashboard is a data visualization application built with modern Python libraries that allows educational stakeholders to analyze student performance patterns. The dashboard presents academic metrics across mathematics, reading, and writing subjects, with interactive filtering capabilities based on demographic factors.
Key Features

Interactive Filtering: Filter performance data by gender and parental education level
Dynamic Visualizations: Real-time updates to visualizations based on selected filters
Distribution Analysis: Visualize score distributions across subjects via intuitive histograms
Comparative Metrics: View and compare average scores by subject through organized bar charts
Automated Exports: Charts automatically saved as PNG files for inclusion in reports
